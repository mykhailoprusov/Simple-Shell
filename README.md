	As a part of our Computer Systems & Architecture module, I was paired with 4 other students in a team and tasked to create a Shell in C programming language. The shell prompts the user for input, reads and parses user input correctly, executes external commands, sets it's home directory, gets the current path when asked and restores it's home path on exiting, changes directories, adds the past 20 commands to an external history file and gets a command from the file and executes it, keeps a persistent history of commands, set ups, invokes, removes and prints aliases and keeps persistent aliases.
